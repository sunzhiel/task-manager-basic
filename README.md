=== PROGRAM NAME === Task Manager

=== DESCRIPTION === This program is a task management application designed for a small business. It works in concert with 2 text files in which are stored user login details and allocated tasks respectively and can read and write data from and to these files.

The program allows users to allocate new tasks to users or view allocated tasks. It also enables those with admin privileges to perform other operations such as registering new users and viewing system statistics. 

This Capstone Project was created during the Department for Education (DfE) sponsored Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev (Nov 2022 cohort).

It demonstrates working with external data sources (files) and also the use of control structures, such as while loops and conditional statements.

=== USAGE === Download the python file (task_manager.py) along with the 2 text files (tasks.txt and user.txt). Ensure you save all 3 files to the same folder.

Run the python file and follow the instructions on the terminal to navigate the menu.
